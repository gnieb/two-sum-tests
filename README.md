# Unit Testing using Mocha and Chai : Two Sum
## About 
 This repo goes along with [THIS](https://medium.com/@grace.nieboer/a-beginners-guide-to-unit-testing-f311469cdc2d?postPublishedType=initial) walk-through blog post on Medium
 ### Built With 
 - JavaScript
 - Mocha
 - Chai



Feel free to use the walk-through blog post or fork and clone this repo for your own use. 

The purpose of this repo is to learn how to write unit tests using mocha and chai testing frameworks. To demonstrate, we will solve the popular algorithmic problem Two Sum, which can be found on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

**The problem:**
- Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

- You can return the answer in any order.
